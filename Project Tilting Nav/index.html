          <h1>Colosseum</h1>
          <small>Wonder of the World</small>
          <p>
            The Colosseum (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo
            [kolosˈsɛːo]) is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of
            Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient
            amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing
            amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction began
            under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed
            in 80 AD under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further
            modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).[3]
            The three emperors that were patrons of the work are known as the
            Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian
            Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro
            Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and
            archaeologists for its association with their family name (Flavius).
            The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic
            rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an estimated 50,000
            to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having
            an average audience of some 65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial
            contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions,
            re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman
            mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be
            used for entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later
            reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a
            religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.
            Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers
            taking spolia, the Colosseum is still an iconic symbol of Imperial
            Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.[7] It
            is one of Rome's most popular tourist attractions and also has links
            to the Roman Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a
            torchlit "Way of the Cross" procession that starts in the area
            around the Colosseum.[8] The Colosseum is depicted on the Italian
            version of the five-cent euro coin.

            Unlike Roman theatres that were built into hillsides, the Colosseum
            is an entirely free-standing structure. It derives its basic
            exterior and interior architecture from that of two theatres back to
            back. It is elliptical in plan and is 189 meters (615 ft / 640 Roman
            feet) long, and 156 meters (510 ft / 528 Roman feet) wide, with a
            base area of 24,000 square metres (6 acres). The height of the outer
            wall is 48 meters (157 ft / 165 Roman feet). The perimeter
            originally measured 545 meters (1,788 ft / 1,835 Roman feet). The
            central arena is an oval 87 m (287 ft) long and 55 m (180 ft) wide,
            surrounded by a wall 5 m (15 ft) high, above which rose tiers of
            seating.
