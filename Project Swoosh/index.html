          <h1>Exercise</h1>
          <p>
            Exercise is basically any physical activity that we perform on a
            repetitive basis for relaxing our body and taking away all the
            mental stress. It is important to do regular exercise. When you do
            this on a daily basis, you become fit both physically and mentally.
            Moreover, not exercising daily can make a person susceptible to
            different diseases. Thus, just like eating food daily, we must also
            exercise daily. The importance of exercise essay will throw more
            light on it.

          <h1>Value of Time</h1>
          <p>
            Time is the most valuable thing in life. It has no beginning and no
            end. It can neither be created nor be destroyed. Time is the only
            dimension in which we all live our lives, and it affects everything
            that we do, from a flower's growing cycle to the destruction of
            empires.

          <h1>Save Water</h1>
          <p>
            Water is not only essential for human beings but also for animals,
            plants, birds, etc. That is why we need to save water. It is as
            essential to life on Earth as air. Water has become scarce due to
            overuse and misuse of water.

          <h1>Green Trees</h1>
          <p>
            Trees are the green cover of the planet. Trees need water, sunshine
            and air to grow. The process of photosynthesis that occurs in trees,
            that helps them grow, uses oxygen and gives out carbon-dioxide.
            Thus, they contribute to the oxygen in the air that we need to
            breathe to stay alive.
